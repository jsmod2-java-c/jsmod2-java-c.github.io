## What is JSmod2?

JSmod2 is a java extension server.
It's based on Smod2 and [ProxyHandler](https://github.com/jsmod2-java-c/ProxyHandler)

The aim of JSmod2 is to make Java developers develop in Java easily.

Also, it provides APIs that most of them are the same as Smod2.

JSmod2 needs Smod2, and you need to install ProxyHandler correctly 
(Grab it into \sm_plugins). In the future, JSmod2 will support 
connecting multiple Smod2 servers.

## How's the project now?

Currently JSmod2 is still developing,
issues, prs, criticsim and suggestions are welcomed!

If you want to participate in the development of JSmod2,
you can refer to [JSmod2-design](https://github.com/jsmod2-java-c/jsmod2-design) for further information.

> How to develop a plugin?

1. New API can register the Listeners and Commands of JSmod2'sï¼›

```java
package com.magiclu.plugin;

import cn.jsmod2.core.annotations.EnableRegister;
import cn.jsmod2.core.annotations.Main;
import cn.jsmod2.core.plugin.PluginBase;

@Main(name="exmaple")

@EnableRegister
public class Main extends PluginBase{
    public void onLoad(){
    }
    public void onEnable(){
    }
    public void onDisable(){
    }
}
```

2. Create a Command:


```java
package com.magiclu.plugin.command;

import cn.jsmod2.api.player.IPlayer;
import cn.jsmod2.core.CommandSender;
import cn.jsmod2.core.command.Command;
import cn.jsmod2.core.plugin.Plugin;

public class TestCommand extends Command{
    
   
    public TestCommand(Plugin plugin){
        super("test","CONSOLE", "hello,jsmod2",plugin);
    }
    //override the method
    public boolean execute(CommandSender commandSender, String[] args){
        //Processing when executing instructions
    }
}

```

3. Create a Listener:


```java
package com.magiclu.plugin.listener;

import cn.jsmod2.api.event.player.IPlayerJoinEvent;
import cn.jsmod2.core.annotations.EventManager;
import cn.jsmod2.core.event.Listener;


public class TestListener implements Listener{
    //EventManager has a listener priority, see the note
    @EventManager
    public void joinEvent(PlayerJoinEvent e){
        //Trigger corresponding event will run
    }
    
}
```
